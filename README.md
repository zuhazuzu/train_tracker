# Train tracker website using React and JavaScript

  

I started this project by reviewing given assignment:

   1.  Check the documentation of the Digitraffic API

        - *Here i can find neccesary train information which i can use in my program*

   2.  Create yourself a public repository in GitHub and start your project

        - *train_tracker is good descritption to this project*

   3.  Choose the programming languages and technologies you feel best to fit for this project. * Remember to hide your API key from your public GitHub repository

        - *In Avanced web-development course  i had recently used JavaScript and React, so these were my choises*

   4.  Develop the functionalities mentioned above to your program.

        - *I gave Copilot prompt: Create website which uses API from DigiTraffic. it should show train locations in map UI. Also it would be nice if it would update train locations automaticly and giving train information to user.*

        - *Copilot gave decent singlepage .html code which had neccesary components, but i found it to be too simple. So i asked Copilot to transform it in to react.*

        - *From here i started adding functionalities: 

            *4.1. Add search bar in header so user can use train number to narrow amount of trains shown in map. resize header to be more user friendly. 

            *4.2. Added train numbers to be shown all the time in map. user does not have to guess them when looking at map.

            *4.3. I did not have API key, but i stii decided to hide API-url which i used in this program. API-url is in .env file which is set in .gitignore file.

            *4.4 Program crashed when there was no connection to API, so i made error handling which shows "odotetaan yhteyttä..." when connection is not available.
            
            *4.5 Lastly i added some comments in code and rewiew to it.

   5.  Create a README.md file for documentation to your GitHub repository.
	   -  *When installed React components i had some instructions to React. I decided to leave most relevant parts end of this document. I decided to make honest documentation how i created this project and what kind o decisions led to this kind of results.*

   6.  Return the task by following the instructions below.
	   *Hope you like this.*
